## F.A.Q.

### Script has no interface

Install Python and add path to install folder in the "Python settings" tab.

For Windows use Python 3.6 as OBS only supports this version.

### Why are there so few settings and animations?

The plugin was made specially for a friend's stream to do a specific tasks. Feel free to add something of your own.
